# Connect-distance-sensor-with-bluetooth-and-6-servo-motors

I connected the distance sensor (ultrasonic) with a bluetooth piece and 6 servo motors, each arm of the robot will have 3 servo motors.

The ultrasonic calculates the distance when a person stands in front of the robot. If the distance is 15 cm or less for 3 seconds, the sensor sends a signal to the Bluetooth to move the arms to say hello.
